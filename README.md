# Identifying Nerve Structures on Ultrasound Images

The goal of this project is to identify the nerve structures in a dataset of ultrasound images. Accurate identification can improve the placement of catheters, which are used to block or mitigate pain during a surgical procedure. 

The specific task is to segment a collection of nerves in the neck called the Brachial Plexus (BP). Experts have manually annotated the BP on a large set of images, which is provided as the training set in a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ultrasound-nerve-segmentation).
